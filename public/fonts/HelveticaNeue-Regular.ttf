This is a binary file, not code. The update requests adding the Helvetica Neue Regular font file to the public/fonts directory. Since I cannot represent a binary file as text, I will represent the action of adding the file.

\`\`\`
// Action: Add HelveticaNeue-Regular.ttf to public/fonts directory.
// This is a binary file and cannot be represented as text.
// The file should be placed in the public/fonts directory.
